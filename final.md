# 9. Final Remarks around Biostatistics

To end this unit, we have to consider the responsibility that we have as scientists in using statistically responsibly. You are going to find that technically you can run almost every test on your data, depending on the research question, but it isn't the right thing to do. At the end of the day, our interpretation of data is based on our own expert analysis and the statistical results. We can't have only one or the other. 

To get a true statistical interpretation of your data, you have to best fit the data into the assumptions of the test. The more it fits, the more likely the statistical results are helpful. 

To end this unit, here is a picture of Sir Ronald Fisher who is considered the father of statistics.
